# Documentation TODO
* Finish text documentation (includes an Algorithms & Standards section!). (Luke)
* Upload alpha app to Google Play App Store. (Luke)
* Add good, consistent screenshots into text docs. (Luke)
* Record and edit tutorial videos for YouTube. (Brian)
* Insert text docs with appropriate assignment of "href" attribute
  for in-text <a>links</a>. This also requires a link to the
