  <h1>Documentation</h1>
  <hr />

  <p>Hi, there! Here's a little documentation about our project. If you have
  questions which are not answered here, please send an email to one of us
  (you can find our contact info in the <b>Developer</b> tab)</p>

  <h2>1. Tutorials</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Logging In</h3>
    <i>TODO</i>

  <h3>1.2. Uploading an Image</h3>

  <h4>1.2.1. Website [<a href="">video</a>]</h4>
  <p>
    <i>TODO</i>
  </p>

  <h4>1.2.2. Android [<a href="">video</a>]</h4>
  <p>
    First off, make sure you download and install the latest AIRPACT-Fire Android app
    <a href="">here</a>. Once you've done that, you're ready to get started!
  </p>
  <p>
    Go ahead and open your app up. It should look something like in Figure 1.
  </p>
  <u>

  <p>
    Once clicked, it may take a little bit to open up the login page
    (until then, you may just be staring at a blank white screen for about 10
    seconds). The login page will appear (Figure 2) and you will then see the
    available <i>Username</i> and <i>Password</i> fields. You will need to be
    registered as a user, and that can be done either on the app (by hitting
    <i>Register here</i>) or through the website <a href="">here</a>. If you area
     have trouble registering, please contact your Administrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> An internet connection is required the first time you login to app.
    After that point, you are free to use the app locally (for that particular
    username and password).
  </p>

    Okay, so you've logged in. Cool! Now you have access to all the app's
    functionality. Since we're trying to get you to submit a picture, go ahead
    and click the <i>Capture</i> button on the top-left of the home screen.
  </p>

    Following the previous step will open up your default camera app. Take a
    picture of the landscape or scene of interest and press the confirmation
    button. Here are some things to keep in mind before you capture an image
    and are ready to proceed to the next step:
    <ul>
      <li>Capture your images in daylight. Our algorithms are not suited for
      nighttime lighting conditions.</li>
      <li>We do not currently support landscape photos. Please keep your phone
      completely vertical (portrait mode) when capturing an image.</li>
      <li>Avoid facing the sun. If this cannot be avoided, try and find a
      positioning of the phone in which the image will contain no "glare."</li>
      <li>We recommend taking a picture of natural landscapes (like mountains,
        hillsides, forests, etc.) with about 10-20% of the picture containing
        open sky (clouds are okay). See Figure 4 for an example of a good
        image capture.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    You will now see the <i>Select Targets</i> page. Here you will do the
    following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><i>Algorithm</i> &mdash; Select desired visual range algorithm to run on
        the image.</li>
      <li><i>Select</i> &mdash; Place your <i>Low</i> and <i>High</i> targets, with
      the <i>Low</i> target being the one placed on the low-contrast point
      (e.g. a mountain, tree, etc.), and the <i>High</i> target being placed at
      a point dependent on the algorithm you picked. Right now, we have two
      options:
      <ul>
        <li>
        <i>Near-Far</i>: The <i>High</i> target would be placed
        on a similar low-contrast point, further from the object upon which
        the <i>Low</i> target was placed.
        </li>
        <li>
        <i>Near-Sky</i>: The <i>High</i> target would be placed on a point on
        the sky almost directly above the low-contrast point.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Once you've got both your targets placed, now comes the tricky part. You
      must now estimate the distance of the object under your <i>Low</i>
      target. We're assuming you're an expert user (e.g. forest ranger), so this
      should be pretty easy for you. You have your choice of distance units,
      miles or kilometers.
      </li>
      <li><i>Submit</i> &mdash; Alright, so you've got the main stuff done.
      Now, we just need you to enter a custom <i>Location</i> tag to this particular
      image. A good example would be "mount baker" if you are at Mount Baker,
      or "palouse hills" if you're staring at the Palouse hills. This will be
      used to group with other images of both a similar view and location, so
      do keep this in mind. Once you've added your location tag, you can add
      an optional description about any additional information that would be of
      use to either you or your fellow users or data analyst researchers. </li>
    </ol>
    Depending on your internet connectivity, you can either locally
    <i>Queue</i> the image, which allows you to submit the image later in your
    local post gallery; or, you could <i>Submit</i> the image, which will
    attempt to push the image (along with the accompanying data you've provided)
    to the website. You'll see a message indicating the success or failur of
    your submission. If it's successful, you can visit the image in website's
    <a href="">gallery</a>. Otherwise, it'll just be queued locally. From there,
    you can attempt to submit a later time.
  </p>
  <p>
    There you go! If all went well, you've just successfully submitted your
    image to the website.
