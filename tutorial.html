  <p>
    Hi, there! Here's a little documentation about our project. If you have
    questions which are not answered here, please send an email to one of us
    (you can find our contact info in the <b>Developer</b> tab).
  </p>

  <h2>1. Tutorials</h2>

  <h3>1.1. Managing Profile</h3>
  <h4>1.1.1. Logging In</h4>
  <p>
    If you don't already have an account, you're going to want to register for
    one <a href="">here</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, we're going to assume you've already got an account. If you're not
    logged in yet, go to the navigation bar at the top of the page (see
    Figure 5) and click <i>Login</i> on the right &mdash; this will bring you
    to a page where you will need to login with your credentials. The page you
    see should be the same as in Figure 6.
  </p>

  </u>
  <p>
    As soon as you login, you'll be brought to your profile page, as you can
    see in Figure 7.
  </p>

  </u>

  <h4>1.1.2. Edit Profile Information</h4>
  <p>
    Once you're looking at your profile page (Figure 7), click the <i>Edit</i>
    button at the top of the content area, directly underneath your <i>Bio</i>.
    That'll bring you to the page where you can edit your profile (Figure 8).
    Go ahead and edit any of these fields, and once you are done don't forget
    to click <i>Submit</i> at the bottom!
  </p>

  <h4>1.1.3. Managing Pictures</h4>
  <p>
    At your profile page (Figure 7), there will be a link labelled
    <i>Manage Pictures</i> right above your personal image gallery. Click that.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here's is the control panel (Figure 9) of all the pictures you've taken.
    Currently, we only support deleting images, so you can click <i>Delete</i>
    on any image you'd like. We recommend only excersizing this functionality
    when necessary, because we are primarily interested in collecting your data!
  </p>

  <h3>1.2. Uploading an Image</h3>

  <h4>1.2.1. Website [<a href="">video</a>]</h4>
  <p>
    Before you do anything, you need to log into your account. Please follow
    Section 1.1.1 for how to log on to the site.
  </p>
  <p>
    There will be a navigation menu on the left of the main page content, as
    seen in Figure 7. Click on <i>Upload</i>, and you will be directed to a
    page that looks like Figure 8.
  <p>
  <u>

  </u>
  <u>

  </u>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Your site Administrator must certify your account in order for
    you to upload an image on the website. Please contact this person if you
    are brought to a page saying that your account is not certified.
  </p>
  <p>
    Obviously, first thing you need to do is upload an image. It's a good idea
    to visit Section 3.1. to see what types of images we support! Once you've
    uploaded a good image, you'll see something like in Figure 9.
  </p>
  <u>
    Figure 10. Uploaded image.
  </u>
  <p>
    But, you're not done yet! You must place the near and far targets on your
    image. What you must do here is place the <i>Near Object</i> on a solid natural
    object, such as a mountain; then, you must place the <i>Far Object</i> on
    a point in the sky, which is hopefully a light blue color (take a look at
    Figure 10).
  </p>
  <u>
    Figure 11. Targets correctly placed on uploaded image.
  </u>
  <p>
    Great! now you must add the estimated <i>Visual Range</i> in the image,
    which we'll use to compare with our computation. Next, enter the
    distance to the <i>Near Target</i> (we're assuming you're good at this).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> Currently, all distances on the site are in kilometers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Now enter the <i>Location</i> of the image, but first please read Section
    3.2 on how to give a nice, descriptive location tag. After that you have
    the option of adding a simple description about image, but you should only
    do this if there is some information which is missing from the picture
    itself that would be useful for researchers to know.
  </p>
  <p>
    Voila! Your image has just been uploaded and you can now view it in the
    <a href="">gallery</a>.
  </p>

  <h4>1.2.2. Android [<a href="">video</a>]</h4>
  <p>
    First off, make sure you download and install the latest AIRPACT-Fire Android app
    <a href="">here</a>. Once you've done that, you're ready to get started!
  </p>
  <p>
    Go ahead and open your app up. It should look something like in Figure 1.
  </p>
  <u>
    Figure 1. App in Android home screen.
  </u>
  <p>
    Once clicked, it may take a little bit to open up the login page
    (until then, you may just be staring at a blank white screen for about 10
    seconds). The login page will appear (Figure 2) and you will then see the
    available <i>Username</i> and <i>Password</i> fields. You will need to be
    registered as a user, and that can be done either on the app (by hitting
    <i>Register here</i>) or through the website <a href="">here</a>. If you area
     have trouble registering, please contact your Administrator.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Note:</b> An internet connection is required the first time you login to app.
    After that point, you are free to use the app locally (for that particular
    username and password).
  </p>
  <u>

  </u>
  <p>
    Okay, so you've logged in. Cool! Now you have access to all the app's
    functionality. Since we're trying to get you to submit a picture, go ahead
    and click the <i>Capture</i> button on the top-left of the home screen.
  </p>
  <u>
    Figure 3. Home screen.
  </u>
  <p>
    Following the previous step will open up your default camera app. Take a
    picture of the landscape or scene of interest and press the confirmation
    button. Please see Section 3.1 for our standard on what images should
    contain.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will now see the <i>Select Targets</i> page. Here you will do the
    following:
    <ol type="a">
      <li><i>Algorithm</i> &mdash; Select desired visual range algorithm to run on
        the image.</li>
      <li><i>Select</i> &mdash; Place your <i>Low</i> and <i>High</i> targets, with
      the <i>Low</i> target being the one placed on the low-contrast point
      (e.g. a mountain, tree, etc.), and the <i>High</i> target being placed at
      a point dependent on the algorithm you picked. Right now, we have two
      options:
      <ul>
        <li>
        <i>Near-Far</i>: The <i>High</i> target would be placed
        on a similar low-contrast point, further from the object upon which
        the <i>Low</i> target was placed.
        </li>
        <li>
        <i>Near-Sky</i>: The <i>High</i> target would be placed on a point on
        the sky almost directly above the low-contrast point.
        </li>
      </ul>
      Once you've got both your targets placed, now comes the tricky part. You
      must now estimate the distance of the object under your <i>Low</i>
      target. We're assuming you're an expert user (e.g. forest ranger), so this
      should be pretty easy for you. You have your choice of distance units,
      miles or kilometers.
      </li>
      <li><i>Submit</i> &mdash; Alright, so you've got the main stuff done.
      Now, we just need you to enter a custom <i>Location</i> tag to this particular
      image. A good example would be "mount baker" if you are at Mount Baker,
      or "palouse hills" if you're staring at the Palouse hills. This will be
      used to group with other images of both a similar view and location, so
      do keep this in mind. Once you've added your location tag, you can add
      an optional description about any additional information that would be of
      use to either you or your fellow users or data analyst researchers. </li>
    </ol>
    Depending on your internet connectivity, you can either locally
    <i>Queue</i> the image, which allows you to submit the image later in your
    local post gallery; or, you could <i>Submit</i> the image, which will
    attempt to push the image (along with the accompanying data you've provided)
    to the website. You'll see a message indicating the success or failure of
    your submission. If it's successful, you can visit the image in website's
    <a href="">gallery</a>. Otherwise, it'll just be queued locally. From there,
    you can attempt to submit a later time.
  </p>
  <p>
    There you go! If all went well, you've just successfully submitted your
    image to the website.

  <h2>2. API</h2>
  <p>
    For the API documentation, please download this <a href="">PDF</a>.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Standards</h2>

  <h3>3.1. Images</h3>
    <p>
      Here are some things that really help us out as we try to process and
      analyze the images you submit. Please keep the following things in mind
      when capturing an image:
      <ul>
        <li>Capture your images in daylight. Our algorithms are not suited for
        nighttime lighting conditions.</li>
        <li>We do not currently support landscape photos. Please keep your phone
        completely vertical (portrait mode) when capturing an image.</li>
        <li>Avoid facing the sun. If this cannot be avoided, try and find a
        positioning of the phone in which the image will contain no "glare."</li>
        <li>We recommend taking a picture of natural landscapes (like mountains,
          hillsides, forests, etc.) with about 10-20% of the picture containing
          open sky (clouds are okay). See Figure 4 for an example of the type of
          images we're looking for.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <u>

    </u>

  <h3>3.2. Location</h3>
  <p>
    How you specify the location on each of your uploaded image matters quite a bit.
    We use this word or phrase to help us group your image with other similar
    images of the same scene (but perhaps at different date in times). Doing
    this right helps us see trends in (our computed) visual range, which helps
    indirectly measure the changes in air quality over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    When giving a location tag, take into account the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Your absolute position.</li>
      <li>The direction you're facing.</li>
    </ul>
    Here are some examples of good location tags:
    <ul>
      <li>mount-baker-front</li>
      <li>mount-ranier-forest</li>
      <li>palouse-hills</li>
      <li>moscow-mountain-back</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
